# Village Water Pump Reliability: A Predictive Maintenance Case Study

Modern machines produce big data from their minutely reporting sensors, to the point that modern solutions are required to address it.

This project uses a Kaggle dataset to explore hidden patterns in sensor data from a single water pump, aiming to minimize the stress associated with false positives or false negatives.

Curious how subtle signals can be turned into understanding? Letâ€™s dive in.
